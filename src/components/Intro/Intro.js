                    Hi, Iâ€™m Grant. I am a Physical Therapist Assistant turned Web Developer. Starting in 2019, I decided on a career change and moved from Alaska to Utah to go to DevMountain.
                    I am excited to continue to learn and use new technologies. I am familiar with Javascript, React, Node, Express, Massive, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS.
                    I have also  utilized other technologies such as Stripe, Sockets, Postman, Git, and Jest and a firm believer in test driven development.

                <p>
                    As seen below are a few of the technologies that I have learned throughout my coding career.
                    My foundation is Javascript but I am interested in learning more.
                </p>
